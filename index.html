      <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
      <p>
        The Checkatrade Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
        assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are highly recommended and should be used most of the time.
          These are well-established and trusted solutions that align with your core principles and practices.
        </li>
        <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be used but are not part of the standard or "golden
          path." These are technologies that are promising and could be used in certain scenarios but are not yet fully
          endorsed as a standard.
        </li>
        <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that you are evaluating for potential future use. These are
          emerging technologies or tools that are being investigated to understand their value and impact on the
          business.
        </li>
        <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are being phased out or deprecated. These are tools or
          solutions that the organization is moving away from and are not recommended for new projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <td>
      <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
      <p>
        The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Platform Team</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the technology
        selection discussions at Checkatrade across the Engineering Community.<br/>
        The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at Checkatrade to pick the best technologies
        for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on
        technology decisions, and continuously evolve our technology landscape.<br/>
        The Tech Radar is a living document and will be updated regularly as our technology landscape evolves.
