      <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
      <p>
        The Checkatrade Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
        assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
          scale, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
        </li>
        <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
          real problem, some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
        </li>
        <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
          technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.
        </li>
        <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Look to phase out.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
      <p>
        The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Platform Team</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the technology
        selection discussions at Checkatrade across the Engineering Community.<br/>
